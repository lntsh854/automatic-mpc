%% DOCUMENTATION
% This algorithm calculates the control signal as constant. This constant
% may be different for each control signal. To get control value of 2 for
% first contol signal and 10 for second one, "control_value" variable must
% be defined as follows
%
% control_value = [2;10];

control_value = zeros(1,1); 
%% STOP
% here one can define additional functions
